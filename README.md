Javascript fiddles. Basiclly the intent with this git is to convert the other space-invader javascript game to use Javascript objects and patterns and basically improve it in terms of making it a bit easier to understand, perhaps, for newbie javascript developers. 

I think that Git is an *excellent* introduction to game's programming in HTML 5, and my code should be, or will be, or probably might be, viewed as another way to crack a HTML 5 game, but this time using design patterns. That's the intent. Also, should teach me quite a lot about Javascript along the way. I know how do this sort of thing in other langauges, but this is a first for me in Javascript. Simple! Or maybe not. will find out soon.
